## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Android Studio **Flamingo** or newer
- Kotlin **1.9+**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Set the Alarm**: User picks a time using the TimePicker.
2. **Broadcast Receiver**: `AlarmReceiver` receives the signal and triggers the service.
3. **Foreground Alarm Service**: `AlarmService` starts playing a looping alarm and vibration.
4. **Quiz Launch**: `AlarmActivity` pops up with a mandatory 10-question quiz.
5. **Victory**: Solve the quiz to stop the noise and vibrations.
